# WoW-Combatant-Battle-Rating
Fetches data from the warcraft logs API in order to rate players based on their overall performance during a fight. 
Up and running at wowcbr.com Fun end of summer project to familiarize myself with a bunch of different technologies. Score is based on your parse, avoidable damage taken, and contribution through things like soaks, casts, de-activating traps etc. Might continue to improve and update it as 10.2 comes out but for now gotta focus on schoolwork.
